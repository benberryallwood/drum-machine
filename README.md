# Drum Machine

This is the third project for the *Front End Development Libraries Certification* provided by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).

I chose to complete it using React and SCSS and have published the gh-pages branch of this repository on [GitHub Pages](https://benberryallwood.github.io/drum-machine).

## freeCodeCamp

freeCodeCamp offer many free online certifications, with a vast amount of resources to learn from as well as very regular articles.
Incidentally, I would also highly recommend Quincy Larson's mailing list; he sends five links to articles, videos or similar each week which are very interesting and useful (to me at least).

## About This Project

Here are the [details about the aims](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-drum-machine) of this project.
The course that this project is part of covers:

- Bootstrap
- jQuery
- SASS
- React
- Redux
- React and Redux together.

Of these, I used React and SCSS.

I will note that [line 32 of index.html](https://github.com/benberryallwood/random-quote-machine/blob/883d454f96171eba1476dfb260faf06330d4cdc8/index.html#L32) contains the freeCodeCamp testing script.
My project has passed the tests included and it is now commented out for aesthetic reasons.
